Northwestern CIERA REU Code
This repository contains the code used during the CIERA REU at Northwestern University. It is organized into separate folders for different aspects of the project, including custom modifications to the harmpi code for specific simulations and analysis files.

Folder Structure
1. analysis/
This folder contains the analysis scripts used to process and visualize the simulation results. These files are designed to extract useful insights from the output of the simulations and assist with interpreting the data.

2. harmpi2D_0.9spin/
This folder includes the modified harmpi code used for the 2D simulation runs with a 0.9 spin parameter. The files in this directory represent the changes and customizations made for this specific setup.

3. harmpi3D_0.9spin/
Similar to the harmpi2D_0.9spin folder, this folder contains the modified harmpi code used for the 3D simulation runs with a 0.9 spin parameter. It includes the necessary files that were changed for this configuration.
